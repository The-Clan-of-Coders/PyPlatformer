This is an attempt at creating a 2D side-scrolling platform game using cocos2d,

If you examine the source you'll find some potentially useful modules for
loading Tiled format maps, a component-based game actor system, and a simple
level geometry editor that serializes to XML.

Running

`python main.py`

Dependencies

pyglet, cocos2d, pymunk
